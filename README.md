MSN Algorithm.

Graph is the class used throughout the program that represents the weighted projections.
Steps 1 and 2 rely heavily on this Graph.

Knot is the class used to represent the 3-D lattice polygon.

msnAlgRunner is the main class with most of the logic for the MSN Algorithm.

Finally, pp-lib is the library that I downloaded and used to run it in parallel on the cluster.
